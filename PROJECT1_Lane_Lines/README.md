---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After learning some techniques of open cv, this project is to apply whatever we have learned during last 1 week. We have learnt, 

1) How to get gray scale image
2) Color selection
3) Region masking
4) Canny edge detection
5) Hough transform and few others.

This project is to test all this topics. Here we need to find lane lines from the images and videos. At the end there is one challenge video there we need to find lane line of curve road.
